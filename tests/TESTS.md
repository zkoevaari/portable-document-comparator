Tests
=====

The sample Open Document Text documents were created with LibreOffice v7.4.7.2 
Writer. The Portable Document Format output files were generated using the 
"Export directly to PDF" function. The ODT sources can be found in the `src`
directory, along with the "This is a test" Inkscape SVG.

Credits for the original text to Marcus Tullius Cicero (45 BC), and to the 
www.lipsum.com service. Naturally, the right-side text had to be modified 
here-and-there to produce differences for demonstration. Although some of the 
sentences most probably became unintelligible this way, I am not convinced
that the left sample is a meaningful excerpt from the ancient source anyway.
